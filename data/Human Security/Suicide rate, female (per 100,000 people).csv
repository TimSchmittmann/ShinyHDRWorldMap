"d: Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified.dddd: Changes in definitions and/or counting rules are reported by the Member State to indicate a break in the time series.vv: In 2009, the Philippine National Police (PNP) has implemented a new crime reporting system wherein crime data for 2009 was set as the baseline for future research, study and comparison. Thus, crime statistics in 2009 cannot be compared with those data obtained in the previous years (2008 and earlier) since the parameters were no longer the same."
