This Shiny application uses Leaflet and D3 to build an interactive worldmap visualizing various data from the Human Development Reports (Latest data from 2016)

You can click on countries to zoom in and select them for display in the sidebar plots. World data color scheme will automatically update after you chose another dimension for display.

The entire series of Human Development Index (HDI) values and rankings are recalculated every year using the same the most recent (revised) data and functional forms. The HDI rankings and values in the 2014 Human Development Report cannot therefore be compared directly to indices published in previous Reports. Please see hdr.undp.org for more information.

The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes.
